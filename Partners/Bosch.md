## Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

Bosch is a global technology company that is heavily involved in the automotive software engineering field. They have a wide range of projects and initiatives that are focused on developing innovative solutions for the automotive industry.

One of the main areas that Bosch is working on in the automotive software engineering field is the development of **advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)**. These systems use sensors, cameras, and other technologies to help vehicles detect and avoid potential hazards on the road. Bosch is also working on the development of autonomous driving systems, which will allow vehicles to operate without direct human intervention.

In addition to ADAS and autonomous driving systems, Bosch is also working on other automotive software engineering projects, such as the development of software platforms for **vehicle communication and connectivity**, as well as the **integration of cloud-based services** into vehicles.


## Potential work areas

1. ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) Development: SEA:ME could partner with Bosch to develop projects focused on ADAS, such as **lane departure warning**, **adaptive cruise control**, and **automated emergency braking systems**. _Students could work on developing and testing these systems using Bosch's hardware and software tools_.
2. Vehicle Communication: SEA:ME could collaborate with Bosch to explore ways to improve communication between vehicles, such as **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)** and **Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)** communication. _This could include developing projects that use Bosch's connectivity and communication solutions to enable safer and more efficient transportation_.
3. Cloud-Based Services: SEA:ME could work with Bosch to develop projects that leverage cloud-based services to enhance the performance and functionality of automotive software systems. For example, students could develop projects that **utilize Bosch's cloud-based analytics tools to optimize vehicle performance, improve fuel efficiency, or reduce emissions**.
4. Cybersecurity: SEA:ME and Bosch could collaborate on projects focused on improving the cybersecurity of automotive software systems. This could include developing projects that **use Bosch's security solutions to protect against cyber attacks**, or exploring ways to **improve the security of software updates and over-the-air (OTA) updates**.
5. Autonomous Vehicles: SEA:ME could partner with Bosch to develop projects focused on autonomous vehicle technology. For example, students could work on developing and testing **autonomous vehicle control systems using Bosch's hardware and software** solutions, or explore ways to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.


## Potential educational projects & requirements

1. **Lane Departure Warning System**:
    - Develop a lane departure warning system using Bosch's hardware and software tools
    - Design and implement algorithms to detect when a vehicle is drifting out of its lane
    - Integrate the lane departure warning system with other ADAS systems, such as adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning
    - Conduct testing and validation to ensure the system is reliable and effective
2. **Automated Emergency Braking System**:
    - Develop an automated emergency braking system using Bosch's hardware and software tools
    - Design and implement algorithms to detect potential collisions and apply the brakes automatically if necessary
    - Integrate the system with other ADAS systems, such as lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control
    - Conduct testing and validation to ensure the system is reliable and effective
3. **Secure Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Updating System**:
    - Develop a secure OTA software updating system using Bosch's hardware and software tools
    - Design and implement security measures to protect against cyber attacks, such as encryption and digital signatures
    - Ensure the system can handle large-scale updates across a fleet of vehicles
    - Conduct testing and validation to ensure the system is secure and reliable
4. **Autonomous Vehicle Control Systems**:
    - Develop a software-based autonomous vehicle control system using Bosch's hardware and software tools
    - Design and implement algorithms to enable the vehicle to navigate and make decisions autonomously
    - Integrate the autonomous vehicle control system with other ADAS systems, such as lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control
    - Conduct testing and validation to ensure the system is reliable and effective, and meets safety standards
