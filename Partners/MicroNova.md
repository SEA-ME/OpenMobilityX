## Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

SEA:ME and MicroNova's collaboration can provide a valuable opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience with advanced automotive testing and simulation technologies. By integrating MicroNova's expertise in HiL simulation, EXAM test automation, and virtualization SiL with SEA:ME's project-based curriculum, students can learn about cutting-edge testing and development tools used in the automotive industry. The collaboration can include developing educational projects in the areas of HiL simulation for ADAS, EXAM test automation for autonomous driving systems, virtualization SiL for connected vehicle testing, and integration of HiL and SiL technologies. Through this collaboration, students can gain exposure to industry-leading technologies and develop skills highly relevant to the automotive sector, preparing them to become future automotive software engineers.


## Potential work areas

1. HiL Simulation for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS): In this project, students will use MicroNova's HiL simulation technology to develop and test ADAS features such as lane departure warning, collision avoidance, and adaptive cruise control. They will work with real-world vehicle models and control units to simulate different driving scenarios and optimize the performance of the ADAS features.
2. Test Automation for Autonomous Driving Systems: This project will focus on using MicroNova's EXAM test automation software to develop and execute test cases for autonomous driving systems. Students will learn how to create reusable test cases that can be applied across different development stages and sites, and how to use EXAM to generate reports and analyze test results.
3. Virtualization SiL for Connected Vehicle Testing: In this project, students will explore MicroNova's virtualization SiL technology to test connected vehicle features such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and predictive maintenance. They will create virtual test environments with real and simulated components and use cloud technology to enable automatic configurability and scalability.
4. Integration of HiL and SiL Technologies: This project will focus on integrating MicroNova's HiL and SiL technologies to develop a comprehensive testing solution for automotive and mobility software engineering. Students will work with real-world hardware and virtual components to simulate different driving scenarios and test various features such as ADAS, V2V communication, and predictive maintenance. They will learn how to use the integrated solution to optimize the performance and reliability of the software components.
