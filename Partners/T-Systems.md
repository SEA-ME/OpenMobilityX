## Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

T-Systems provides global ICT services for the automotive and mobility industry, including remote-controlled driving, see-through technology, and software-defined cars. The collaboration with SEA:ME aims to enhance the students' learning experience by developing educational projects on tele-operated driving, see-through tech, software-defined cars, digital twin tech, and cloud-based services. This partnership offers students the chance to work with advanced tools and technologies relevant to the industry.


## Potential work areas

1. Tele-Operated Driving: SEA:ME could partner with T-Systems to develop projects focused on tele-operated driving, which involves controlling a vehicle remotely using advanced software and communication technologies. Students could work on developing and testing **tele-operated driving systems** using T-Systems' hardware and software tools.
2. See-Through Technology: SEA:ME could collaborate with T-Systems to explore ways to improve visibility and safety on the road using see-through technology, which enables vehicles to **"see" through obstacles**(eg. the car/truck in front) by processing cameras and other sensors data coming from those obstacles. This could include developing projects that use T-Systems' connectivity and communication solutions to enable safer and more efficient transportation.
3. Software Defined Car: SEA:ME could work with T-Systems to develop projects that leverage **software defined car** technology to enhance the performance and functionality of automotive software systems. For example, students could develop projects that utilize T-Systems' software defined car platform to optimize vehicle performance, improve fuel efficiency, or reduce emissions.
4. Digital Twin: SEA:ME and T-Systems could collaborate on projects focused on creating a **digital twin of a vehicle**, which is a virtual replica of the physical vehicle. This could include developing projects that use T-Systems' simulation tools to optimize vehicle design, test different scenarios, or explore new technologies.
5. Cloud-Based Services: SEA:ME could partner with T-Systems to develop projects that leverage cloud-based services to enhance the performance and functionality of automotive software systems. For example, students could develop projects that utilize T-Systems' cloud-based analytics tools to **optimize vehicle performance, improve fuel efficiency, or reduce emissions**.


## Potential educational projects & requirements

1. **Tele-Operated Driving (Remote Controlled Car)**:
    1. Develop a tele-operated driving system that allows a remote operator to control a vehicle in real-time using a video feed and communication link.
    2. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the live video feed from the vehicle's cameras, as well as the vehicle's speed, position, and other telemetry data.
    3. Implement safety features, such as automatic emergency braking and obstacle detection, to prevent collisions and ensure safe operation of the vehicle.
    4. Test the tele-operated driving system in a controlled environment, such as a closed course or simulation, to evaluate its performance and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Software Defined Car (Digital Twin Concept)**:
    5. Develop a digital twin of a vehicle using software-defined car technology, which enables real-time adjustments to the vehicle's software and hardware.
    6. Create a simulation environment that replicates real-world driving conditions, including different road types, weather conditions, and traffic scenarios.
    7. Implement machine learning algorithms to optimize vehicle performance, such as fuel efficiency, acceleration, and braking.
    8. Test the digital twin in the simulation environment to evaluate its performance and identify areas for improvement.
3. **See-Through Cars/Truck Ahead to Improve Road Safety**:
    9. Develop a see-through technology system that uses cameras and other sensors’ data shared by vehicle (car/truck) ahead to detect obstacles and hazards on the road from far ahead, even if they are obstructed by other vehicles.
    10. Create an algorithm that processes sensor data in real-time to create a virtual "see-through" view of the road ahead.
    11. Implement a user interface that displays the virtual "see-through" view to the driver, along with real-time warnings and alerts for potential hazards.
    12. Test the see-through technology system in a variety of driving scenarios to evaluate its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
4. **Secure Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Updating System**:
    13. Develop a secure OTA software updating system using T-System’s hardware and software tools
    14. Design and implement security measures to protect against cyber attacks, such as encryption and digital signatures
    15. Ensure the system can handle large-scale updates across a fleet of vehicles
    16. Conduct testing and validation to ensure the system is secure and reliable
