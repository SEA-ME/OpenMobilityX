# SdV & SdM
Software-defined vehicles (SdV) and software-defined mobility (SdM) are related concepts but they are not the same thing.
- SdV refers specifically to the integration of software and digital technologies into the design and operation of vehicles. This includes the use of sensors, cameras, connectivity, and other digital technologies to create smarter, more efficient, and more personalized vehicles. SdV also includes the development of autonomous vehicles that can operate without human input.
- On the other hand, SdM refers to the broader concept of using software and digital technologies to optimize all aspects of transportation and mobility, not just vehicles. SdM encompasses a wide range of technologies and approaches, including intelligent transportation systems (ITS), mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), connected vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs), and autonomous vehicles (AVs), as well as infrastructure, data analytics, and digital platforms that enable smarter and more efficient transportation systems.
  
In summary, while SdV is a subset of SdM, it focuses specifically on the integration of software and digital technologies into the design and operation of vehicles, while SdM is a broader concept that encompasses all aspects of transportation and mobility, including vehicles, infrastructure, and digital platforms.
